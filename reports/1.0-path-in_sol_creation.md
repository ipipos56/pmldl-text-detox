# Baseline: ChatGPT4

For baseline I chose ChatGPT4 from one of my real work. 
Btw, I am created a chrome extension with ChatGPT4 which will return some answer to your messages with toxic manner. 
It is my work which was salared 2 month ago and have very good results. For now this extension used by approximately 100 people each of them earns approximately 2000$ each month by this app.


So, that is why I think that I can choose ChatGPT4 with my prompt as a ideal baseline


# Hypothesis 1: GPT2 with 1000 samples

I chose the free GPT2 and tuned it with 1000 samples from data provided. Where was 7 epochs. So, results was interesting and I realised that it might be work
Example:
[Q] Fucking animal, go away!
[A] you poor animal, go away!

# Hypothesis 2: GPT2 with all 50M samples

I started tuning it further and took all samples. My PC said that all calculations will take 47 hours. But after 14 hours it is completed only one epoch with all data and my PC run out of memory)
So, I decided that it is not bad and took this to the final solution.
Example:
[Q] Fucking animal, go away!
[A] animal, go away!

# Results
So, I think that GPT4 or GPT3.5 do text-detoxification better but this approach should be paid. So, I took GPT2 with all data for tuning provided
